        <h3>My Professional and Education Background:</h3>
        <p id="aboutMe1">I am a senior computer science student at the University of Massachusetts Lowell while also working as 
            a network engineer rotating between part-time and full time. Up to this point I have had the chance to learn about Machine Learning,
            Cyber Security(Analysis and Risk Management), Networking and Infrastructure Engineering, and Robotics among other classes that have
            allowed me to take a deep dive into the field of computer science.
        </p>
        <p id='aboutMe2'>
            This class is actually my first dive into web-developer programming and my first time working with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
            I am very excited to learn more about these langauges as well as the GIT repository process as I feel these are skills that 
            will be important in any future programming endeavors. One of the side projects I've been mulling for a long time is my own website so 
            this project has been an exciting opprotunity to work on those skills needed for that.
         </p>
         <h3>Outside of the Classroom:</h3>
         <p id="aboutMe3">
            Below I've included a table that highlights some of my favorite activities outside of school and work and a brief description of my background
            in those hobbies.
         </p>
         <!--Included a table of some of my favorite activities using 2 columns and 3 rows-->
         <h4>Some of my Favorite Activities:</h4>
         <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Activity</th>
                <th>My Background</th>

            <tr>
                <th>Hiking</th>
                <th>One of my favorite outdoor activities is hiking, New England and especially the White Mountains in New Hampshire contain some of the best
                    views and trails I have ever seen. I am currently working on completing the 48 4000 footers in the White Mountains as well as a list called
                    the terrifying 25.
                </th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Ice Hockey</th>
                <th>I picked up Ice Hockey back in October 2023 and try to get out and play at least once a week since then. I'm currently on a rec league team
                    and get to play an organized game once a week.
                </th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Guitar</th>
                <th>A litle under 6 years ago I went out an bought my first acoustic guitar, since then I've played on and off practicing at home.
                    I now have an electric and acoustic guitar and I use them both to try and cover some of my favorite songs. </th>
