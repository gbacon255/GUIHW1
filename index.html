        </figure>
        <p>I am a senior computer science student at the University of Massachusetts Lowell while also working as 
            a network engineer rotating between part-time and full time. Up to this point I have had the chance to learn about Machine Learning,
            Cyber Security(Analysis and Risk Management), Networking and Infrastructure Engineering, and Robotics among other classes that have
            allowed me to take a deep dive into the field of computer science.
        </p>
        <p>
            This class is actually my first dive into web-developer programmingand my first time working with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
            I am very excited to learn more about these langauges as well as the GIT repository process as I feel these are skills that 
            will be important in any future programming endeavors. One of the side projects I've been mulling for a long time is my own website so 
            this project has been an exciting opprotunity to work on those skills needed for that.
